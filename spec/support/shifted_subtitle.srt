00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:31,651
Little girl?

4
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,681
Little girl.

5
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,461
Don't be afraid, OK?

6
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,981
Little girl.

7
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,091
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,421
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

9
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:09,861
I never met a woman who knew
how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,999
They're born thinking the
switch only goes one way... On.

11
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,247
They're struck blind the
second they leave a room.

12
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,902
I mean every woman, I ever let
have a key... I swear to God.

13
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,087
It's like I... come home,
house is all lit up,

14
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,004
and my job, you see,
apparently... because...

15
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,930
because my chromosomes
happen to be different

16
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,901
cause I then gotta walk
through that house,

17
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,641
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

18
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,491
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

19
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,361
Alright, Reverend Shane's
preaching to you now, boy.

20
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,281
The same chick, mind ya.

21
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,971
She'll bitch about global warming.

22
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:50,345
That's when Reverend
Shane wants to

23
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:53,631
quote from the Guy Gospel
and say "Um, darling?"

24
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:57,401
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

25
00:05:57,402 --> 00:06:00,698
just figured out that the light
switch see, goes both ways,"

26
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,281
maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

27
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,551
- You say that?
- Yeah.

28
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,771
Anyway, uh... Polite version...

29
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,021
Still man, that...
that earns me this.

30
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:14,681
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

31
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,881
And that's when the
exorcist voice pops out.

32
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,711
"You sound just
like my damn father.

33
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,115
"Always, always yelling
about the power bill,"

34
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,261
"telling me to turn
off the damn lights."

35
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,581
What do you say to that?

36
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,201
You know what I wanna say.

37
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,881
I wanna say,"Bitch,
you mean to tell me

38
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,481
you've been hearing
this your entire life

39
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:33,721
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

40
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,811
You know... I don't
actually say that, tho.

41
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,201
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

42
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,331
the polite version there...

43
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,321
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,761
So how's it with Lori, man?

45
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,341
She's good. She's good
at turning off lights.

46
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,631
Really good.

47
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,071
I don't know why
sometimes we guess.

48
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,111
Not what I meant.

49
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,841
We didn't have a great night.

50
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:12,191
Look, man, I may have a... fail to
amuse with my sermon, but I did try.

51
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:15,141
The least you could do is speak.

52
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:19,941
That's what she always says:
"Speak".

53
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,591
"Speak".

54
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,145
You think I was the
most closed mouth

55
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,231
son of a bitch you'd ever
hear to hear her tell it.

56
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:32,471
Do you express your thoughts?

57
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,701
You share your feelings
and that kind of stuff?

58
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,551
The thing is...

59
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,391
lately whenever I try...

60
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:48,191
everything I say makes her impatient,
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

61
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,141
It's like she's...

62
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,701
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

63
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,451
Look, man, that's just
shit couples go through.

64
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:01,011
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

65
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:07,351
Last thing she said this morning?

66
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:11,401
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

67
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:16,311
She said that in front of our kid.

68
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,851
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

69
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,471
Difference between men and women?

70
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,731
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

71
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,241
Certainly not in front of Carl.

72
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,965
All available units,
high speed pursuit

73
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,171
in progress Lincoln county
units request local assistance.

74
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,601
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

75
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:50,951
Proceed with extreme caution.

76
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,011
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

77
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:06,901
Be advised, they have
fired on police officers.

78
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:09,791
One Lincoln county
officer is wounded.

79
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,621
Unit 1, Unit 3.

80
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,795
18, 2 miles west of Interstate 85

81
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,811
and we'll patch in Lincoln
County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,291
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,841
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3,
we are 10-97 in code 100.

84
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,811
Highway 18, 85 Interstate,
please advise.

85
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,911
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

86
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,921
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

87
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,801
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

88
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,111
What I think, Leon,
is that you need to stay focused.

89
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:06,831
Make sure you got a round in the
chamber and your safety off.

90
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,761
Would be kind of cool to
get on one of them shows.

91
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,641
Holy shit.

92
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,971
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

93
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,301
Put the gun down!

94
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,491
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

95
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,331
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

96
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,931
Me too.

97
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,521
Son of a bitch shot me.

98
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:21,041
You believe that?

99
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,371
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,671
Yeah.

101
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,471
Shane, you do not tell
Lori that happened.

102
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,151
Ever.

103
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,001
You understand...

104
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,971
Rick! Rick! No, no, no!

105
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:41,681
No, no, no, no... He's hurt!

106
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:43,621
Leon!

107
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,465
You get that ambulance down here,

108
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,231
you tell them there's an
officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:51,201
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me?

110
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:55,021
Okay. Shh, shh,
stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:58,921
Shh, shh, ok?
You stay with me, ok?

112
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:20,121
Hey, bud... We're still here.

113
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,751
We're still hanging in.

114
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,971
Look, I'm sorry, man.

115
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:32,171
I'm mean watching the same
crap every time I come in here.

116
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,571
Everybody pitched in on these.
They uh...

117
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:41,711
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

118
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,471
They hope you come back real soon.

119
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,121
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

120
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,101
You probably could tell, hmm?

121
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:58,131
I'll just set this on
your side table, ok?

122
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,121
That vase has something special.

123
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:12,251
Fess up.

124
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:15,051
Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

125
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,671
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

126
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,181
Shane?

127
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,201
Shane, you in the john?

128
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:54,081
Nurse, help.

129
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,631
Nurse. Help!

130
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:47,293
Lori!

131
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,853
Lori!

132
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:01,943
Carl! Carl!

133
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:09,463
Lori! Carl!

134
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,563
Lori! Carl!

135
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:45,783
Is this real?

136
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,573
Am I here?

137
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:56,473
Wake, wake up!

138
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:11,723
Daddy, daddy!

139
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:14,283
Carl... Carl?

140
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,573
- I found you...
- Daddy, I got this sumbitch.

141
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:18,553
I'm gonna smack him dead.

142
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:26,793
He say something?

143
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,023
I thought I heard
him say something.

144
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:30,583
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

145
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:34,763
Hey, mister!
What's that bandage for?

146
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,253
- What?
- What kind of wound?

147
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,723
You answer me, damn you!

148
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:43,713
What's your wound?

149
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,763
You tell me!

150
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:49,793
Or I will kill you.

151
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,023
Got that bandage changed out.

152
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,273
It was pretty rank.

153
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:18,923
What was?

154
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,103
The wound?

155
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,193
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:27,123
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,723
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:35,543
Look, I ask and you answer,
It's common courtesy, right?

159
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:42,103
Did you get bit?

160
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,213
- Bit?
- Bit.

161
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:46,863
Chewed. Maybe scratch?

162
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:48,953
Anything like that.

163
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:51,873
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,463
Just shot, as far as I know.

165
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,885
Hey... Just let me...

166
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,143
Feels cooler now.

167
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,173
Fever would have
killed you by now.

168
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:10,003
I don't think I have one.

169
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,993
Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:21,183
Take a moment,
eh? Look how sharp it is.

171
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:26,723
You try anything... I will kill you
with it, and don't you think I won't.

172
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:39,903
Come on up when you're able.

173
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,173
Come on.

174
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,070
This place... It's
Fred and Cindy Drake's.

175
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,300
Never met them.

176
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,190
I've been here. This is their place

177
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,940
It was empty when we got here.

178
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,300
Don't do that.

179
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,310
They'll see the light.

180
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,890
There's more of them
out there than usual.

181
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,910
I never should have
fired that gun today.

182
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,490
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

183
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,520
Stupid... using a gun...

184
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,210
It all happened so fast...

185
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,030
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

186
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,570
Man?

187
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,440
No man...

188
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,190
What the hell was that out
of your mouth just now?

189
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,260
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

190
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,130
In this street, out front, a man.

191
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,460
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

192
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,310
Come on.

193
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,070
Sit down, before you fall down.

194
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,840
Here. Eat.

195
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,650
Daddy... Blessing...

196
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,550
Yeah.

197
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,260
Father, we thank thee for this food...
Thy blessings...

198
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,680
We ask you to watch over
us in these crazy days.

199
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,210
- Amen.
- Amen.

200
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,500
Hey, mister, do you even
know what is going on?

201
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,970
I woke up today.

202
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,450
In a hospital.

203
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,640
Came home, that's all I know.

204
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,430
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

205
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,730
Out on the loading dock,
hauling trucks.

206
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,710
No... Not the one's they put down...
The one's they didn't.

207
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,980
The walkers.

208
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,190
Like the one I shot today.

209
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,040
Cause he would have
ripped into you.

210
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,700
Try to eat you,
take him some flesh at least.

211
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,770
But I guess if this is the first you're
hearing, I know how it must sound...

212
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,880
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

213
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,500
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

214
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,850
Maybe it's the cool air or... Hell, maybe
it's just me firing up that gun today.

215
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,770
But we'll be fine
long as we stay quiet.

216
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,960
Probably wander off by morning.

217
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,730
Well, listen...

218
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,650
One thing I do know...
Don't you get bit!

219
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,420
We saw your bandage and
that's why we were afraid of.

220
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,100
Bites kill you.

221
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,020
The fever... burns you out.

222
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,020
But then after a while...

223
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,730
You come back.

224
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,850
Seen it happen...

225
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,070
Come on...

226
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,790
Carl... He your son?

227
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,080
William. He said his name today...

228
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,000
He's a little younger...
than your boy.

229
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,740
And he's with his mother?

230
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,010
I hope so.

231
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,080
- Dad?
- Yeah?

232
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,650
Did you ask him?

233
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,170
Your gun shot...
We got a little bet going.

234
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,240
My boy say you're a...
bank robber...

235
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,390
Yeah...That's me.

236
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,720
Deadly as Dillinger Kapow.

237
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,500
Sheriff's deputy

238
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,380
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

239
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,400
It's nothing.

240
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,290
One of them must've
bumped a car...

241
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,070
You sure?

242
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,380
Happened once before.

243
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,370
Went off a few minutes.

244
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,250
Get the light, Dwayne.

245
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,840
It's the blue one,
down the street.

246
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,100
Same one as last time.

247
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,380
I think we're ok.

248
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,900
That noise... Will it
bring more of them?

249
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,510
Nothing to do about it now.

250
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,720
Just have to wait 'em
out till morning.

251
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,720
She's here.

252
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,010
Don't look.

253
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,440
Get away from the windows.

254
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,930
I said go! Come on!

255
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,650
Come on, quiet.

256
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,560
It's ok, here.

257
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,480
Cry into the pillow.

258
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,930
Can you remember?

259
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,100
She, uh...

260
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,430
She died in the other room,
on that bed...

261
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,680
Nothin' I can do about it here...
That fever, man...

262
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,980
Her skin gave off
heat like a furnace...

263
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,950
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

264
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,030
You know what... I just
didn't have it in me...

265
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,000
She's the mother of my child.

266
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,380
You sure? They're dead.

267
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,330
They have to ask,
at least one more time.

268
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,260
They're dead.

269
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,570
Except for something in the brain.

270
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,060
That's why it's gotta be the head.

271
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
You alright?

272
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,850
Need a moment

273
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,820
They're alive.

274
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,510
My wife and son.

275
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,540
At least they were when they left.

276
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,460
How can you know?

277
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,780
By the look of this place...

278
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,400
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

279
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,520
They packed some clothes.
Not a lot.

280
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,100
But enough to travel.

281
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,810
You know anybody could've broken
in here and stolen clothes, right?

282
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,330
You see the framed
photos on the walls?

283
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,480
Neither do I.

284
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Some random thief took
those too, you think?

285
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,720
My photo albums,
family pictures, all gone.

286
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,210
Photo albums...

287
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,890
My wife... Same thing...

288
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,390
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

289
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,540
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

290
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,650
That's right.

291
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,770
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

292
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,990
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

293
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,920
Military protection food,
shelter... They told people to go there.

294
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,040
Said to be safest.

295
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,180
Plus they got that disease place.

296
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,860
Center for Disease Control.

297
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,040
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

298
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,320
Gas and light have been
down for maybe a month.

299
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,420
Station got its own
propane system.

300
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,360
Pilot's still on.

301
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,800
Oh, my Lord.

302
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,630
Hot water!

303
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,120
That feels good, right?

304
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,850
* Bring it, bring it, bring it around...
Ahah. *

305
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,880
* What did you say, what...*

306
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,811
Dwayne... Dress in
room back there.

307
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:02,341
- What would you say, Dwayne?
- Thank you.

308
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:10,161
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

309
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:13,541
Safer anyway. People...

310
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,171
That's where we were heading.

311
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,631
Things got crazy.

312
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,021
Man, you won't believe.

313
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:19,985
The panic...

314
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:23,641
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

315
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:27,411
My wife... couldn't travel.

316
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,981
No, not with our herds,
so we had to find a place to lay low.

317
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,801
And then, after she died...

318
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,521
We just stayed hunkered down.

319
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:42,281
I guess we just froze in place.

320
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:45,951
Plan to move on?

321
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,611
Haven't worked up to it yet.

322
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:01,861
A lot of it's gone missing.

323
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,341
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

324
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:05,891
I'm old enough.

325
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:07,251
Hell yes you're going to learn.

326
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,681
We gotta do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

327
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,781
That's right. It's not a toy.

328
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,611
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

329
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:15,111
Always remember that, Dwayne.

330
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,781
Yes, sir.

331
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,201
Here.

332
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:23,671
Go on.

333
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,001
Take that one.

334
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,651
Nothing fancy.

335
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:32,721
Scope's accurate.

336
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,811
Conserve your ammo.

337
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:50,571
Goes faster than you think.
Especially at target practice.

338
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,031
Dwayne.

339
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,381
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

340
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:58,541
You sure you won't come along?

341
00:41:58,751 --> 00:41:59,691
A few more days...

342
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:03,811
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

343
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,591
You got one better.

344
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,371
I'll turn mine on,
a few minutes every day at dawn.

345
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:18,071
You get up there,
that's how you find me.

346
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:19,731
You think they're here?

347
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:22,001
Can't afford not to. Not anymore.

348
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,311
Look, just one thing.

349
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:26,922
They may not seem like
much one at a time...

350
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:29,291
but in a group all
round up and hungry...

351
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,041
Man, you watch your ass.

352
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,781
You too.

353
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:35,891
You a good man, Rick.

354
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:38,721
I hope you find your wife and son.

355
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:42,111
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

356
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:43,991
Take care of your old man.

357
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,681
Yes, sir.

358
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:57,181
Leon Bessi?

359
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:03,451
Didn't think much of him.

360
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,811
Careless and dumb,
but... can't leave him like this.

361
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:14,061
You know, if they hear the shot.?

362
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:15,841
Let's not be here
when they show up.

363
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:18,281
Let's go, son. Come on.

364
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,561
Read your comic books a while.

365
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:55,671
Daddy'll be upstairs.

366
00:46:57,171 --> 00:46:58,101
Daddy?

367
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,841
It's alright, Dwayne.

368
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:03,141
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

369
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:33,651
Come on, baby.

370
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:07,361
I'm sorry this happened to you.

371
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,941
Come on, come on.

372
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:58,512
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

373
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,492
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

374
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,682
Anybody reads, please respond.

375
00:50:06,622 --> 00:50:08,522
Hello. Hello.

376
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:11,102
Can anybody hear my voice?

377
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:16,902
Anybody out there? Anybody hears me,
please respond.

378
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:20,912
Hello, can you hear my voice?

379
00:50:21,022 --> 00:50:24,012
Hello? Hello?
Can anybody hear my voice?

380
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:27,672
Yes, I can hear you.

381
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:29,742
You're coming through. Over.

382
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:32,662
Anybody who reads, please respond.

383
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,162
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

384
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:38,032
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

385
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:40,422
Anybody reads, please respond.

386
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,872
We're just outside the city.

387
00:50:46,312 --> 00:50:47,882
Damn it.

388
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:50,472
Hello? Hello?

389
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,212
He couldn't hear me.
I couldn't warn him.

390
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:53,572
Try to raise him again.

391
00:50:53,622 --> 00:50:55,962
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

392
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:01,092
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

393
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:05,432
This is officer Shane Walsh,

394
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:08,082
broadcasting a person unknown,
please respond.

395
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:16,712
He's gone.

396
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:19,442
There are others.

397
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:20,882
It's not just us.

398
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:21,712
Yeah, We knew there
would be, right,

399
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:23,402
that's why we let the CB on.

400
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:25,652
A lot of good it's been doing.

401
00:51:25,872 --> 00:51:27,380
And I've been saying for a week,

402
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:29,070
we ought to put signs up on 85

403
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:29,972
to warn people away from the city.

404
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,522
Folks got no idea what
they're getting into.

405
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:35,242
We don't have enough time.

406
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:38,182
I think we need to make time.

407
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:42,012
Yeah, that, uh... That's
a luxury we can't afford.

408
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,772
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

409
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,352
And who the hell would
you propose to send?

410
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:49,282
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

411
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,612
Nobody goes anywhere alone,
you know that.

412
00:51:57,302 --> 00:51:58,572
Yes, sir.

413
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,502
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
take a sit, buddy.

414
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,562
You're alright, go on,
you're alright.

415
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,772
What, you're pissed at me?

416
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:12,922
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

417
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:16,732
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

418
00:52:16,802 --> 00:52:18,432
I'm not doing it for anything.

419
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:19,530
I make you feel like

420
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:21,902
sometimes you wanna slap
me outside the head...

421
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:22,635
I'll tell you what, girl.

422
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,002
You feel that need,
you go right ahead.

423
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:25,582
I'm right here.

424
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:32,712
You cannot walk off like that,
all half-cocked.

425
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:35,153
Look, if you don't wanna do it
for my sake or for your sake,

426
00:52:35,154 --> 00:52:35,732
that's fine.

427
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:39,342
But just... You do it for him.

428
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:42,852
That boy has been
through too much.

429
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:45,622
And he's not losing
his mother too, ok?

430
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:49,332
- Okay.
- Ok, fine.

431
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:55,282
You tell me okay.

432
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:03,262
It's not hard.

433
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:23,782
Mom?

434
00:53:27,602 --> 00:53:29,312
What's up, buddy?
She's in there, go on.

435
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:34,062
I don't want you to worry.

436
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:36,042
Your mom is not going
anywhere. Okay?

437
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,212
Yeah? Yeah?

438
00:53:39,272 --> 00:53:41,382
- Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

439
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:25,590
Hello?

440
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,516
Police officer out here.

441
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:34,536
Can I borrow some gas?

442
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:44,116
Hello?

443
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:52,916
Hello? Anybody home?

444
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:41,836
Easy now, easy.

445
00:56:41,986 --> 00:56:43,866
I'm not gonna hurt you.

446
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:45,966
Nothing like that.

447
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:50,516
More like a proposal.

448
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:52,646
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

449
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:54,006
It's safe there.

450
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:58,526
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

451
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:02,376
How's that sound?

452
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:08,566
There we go. Good boy. Good boy.

453
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:11,426
Now come with me. Come with me.

454
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,126
Let's go easy, ok?

455
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:26,686
I haven't done this for years.

456
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:37,686
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

457
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:52,969
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

458
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,589
Okay.

459
01:02:43,919 --> 01:02:45,919
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

460
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:12,489
Hey, you.

461
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:16,729
Dumb ass.

462
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:19,849
Hey, you in the tank.

463
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:21,869
Cozy in there?

464
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:52,899
